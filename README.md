# useR -- Tools for the Analysis of Ecological Data

## Site Purpose rufing me???

A general access site for delivery of R--based courses used to instruct students and others in the application R to data associated with natural resources management and conservation issues.  This site is, of course, only one of many related to applications of R.  However, it does have specific focus on learning to use R for analyses related to natural resources, especially in the realms of fisheries, wildlife, and habitat management.

If you are on this site, you likely fall into one of the three general categories below:

* Student at Utah State University
* Student elsewhere
* Federal or state biologist 

In all cases learning to analyze data using R is a desired outcome.  

Students -- typically working towards undergraduate or graduate degrees in management, conservation or ecology -- can use the site to get a jump--start on use and application of R biological data.  At the undergraduate level, more and more agencies are turning to the power of R as part of day--to-day data management and analysis activities. Thus, expertise in R may offer employment advantages. Graduate students simply cannot analyze their research data in today's world without knowledge of R. Simply stated, the vast majority of sophisticated analyses applied to data are found in numerous R packages.  And although active biologists with Federal or state agencies may have a slightly different perspective -- that of analysis of data of direct importance to a current--day management issue vs. pure research -- they, too, will find R a useful tool for meeting analytical goals.
